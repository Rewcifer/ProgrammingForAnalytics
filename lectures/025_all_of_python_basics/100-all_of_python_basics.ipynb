    "Python is among those languages which provide a way to represent `True` and `False` directly. This data type is unexpectedly common in programming languages. For example, if you ask Python if 5 is greater than 3, the answer will be a boolean value (hint: True). Numeric values have associated operations we are used to from school: addition, subtraction, etc. String types have natural function associated with them such as upper case, lower case, combining strings, etc. Similarly, there is a \"boolean algebra.\" We will introduce this later in the lecture.\n",

Booleans are an integral part of such decisions. `if` a boolean value is `True`, then do this thing, `else` do something else. The operations carried out by your program depend on the value of a boolean value."
