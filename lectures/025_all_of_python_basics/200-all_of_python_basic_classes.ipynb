    "#### Classes vs objects\n",
    "In the code above, `Student` is a class. Objects are created from classes when they are _instantiated_, such as when we call `Student(\"Bart\", 34, 81, 10)` as a function. In that scenario, `bart` is the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common metaphore is to say that a class is like a cookie cutter and an object is the cookie. They are very closely related concepts and working programmers often just use the term _object_ to define the class as well as the objects created from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions vs methods\n",
    "Functions which access values internal to an object are called methods. For example, the `get_age` method refers to the `age` variable, which is internal to objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several things in the class definition above which may strike you as odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `self` \n",
    "The keyword `self` is used to refer to the internal memory of the class. For example, in the snippet below\n",
    "```python\n",
    "...\n",
    "    def get_name(self): return self.name\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The term `return self.name` means, return the `name` variable, which is part of the `bart` object. The definition `def get_name(self):` means that this method accesses a value internal to the `bart` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self` keyword ensures that `bart.get_age()` returns `age`, which is specific to Bart and `lisa.get_age()` returns `age` which is specific to her.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__init__()`\n",
    "`__init__` is called a _constructor_. Note that there are _two_ underscores before and after the word init. Notice that we called the `Student` class as if it was a function: `Student(\"Lisa\", 97, 15, 8)`. When we use this syntax, it is the `__init__` function which is actually called. Notice that our parameters `\"Lisa\", 97, 15, 8` match perfectly with the constructor defined for the class `Student`: `def __init__(self, name, grade, aggressiveness, age):` (and remember that the first argument is always self, to make sure the function can access values internal to the `Student` class.\n",

    "### Inheritance\n",
    "For our purpose, inheritance is one of the most important properties of object oriented programming. Although this concept is not universally liked in the software engineering community, most mainstream programmers use inheritance, at least to some extent, to organize their code. For our purpose, several important data science libraries are organized using inheritance.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We have defined a `Student` class, but now we wish to keep track of adults at the school as well. Like students, adults have names, ages and aggressiveness. The `grade` variable makes no sense for adults, since they have already graduated. On the other hand, adults _do_ have professions, which doesn't make sense for students.\n",
